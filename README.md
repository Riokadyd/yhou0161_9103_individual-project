Perlin Noise can introduce smooth random movements and enhance visual effects. For this personal assignment, I will also use Perlin Noise to create various animation effects.

## 🎮 Interaction

Since my task is to animate with Perlin Noise, the animation is random. Therefore, I didn’t create many interactions. Instead, I focused more on effects and animations. The only interaction present is a slider on the right side of the game console, which controls the movement range of the Green Ghost:
- Slide to the right to increase its range of motion.
- Slide to the left to decrease its range of motion.

The concert will play automatically after you open the window and will loop.

## 💡 Details and Approaches

In the arcade screen, we have set up five characters, including four colourful ghosts and a yellow Pac-Man. I created unique animation effects for each of these five characters.
